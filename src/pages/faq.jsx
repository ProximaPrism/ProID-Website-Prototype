            This is the page where I answer information about this web application and some meta information about my prototype.

            Is this your final product of the web application?

          <p className="text-lg py-6 pb-0">
            No, it is not. There is a bunch of functionality that I have missed out or ran out of time, such as this webpage which I made in 10 mins.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg py-0">
            However, with the time and other projects at hand, I would say that I am quite satisfied with the result overall.

            Yes, I will. This project has actually been a great learning experience for me in applying my diploma-related expertise
