## FAQ
This FAQ section is taken directly from the FAQ page in the website.

### Is this your final product of the web application?
No, it is not. There is a bunch of functionality that I have missed out or ran out of time, such as this page which I made in 10 mins.             

However, with the time and other projects at hand, I would say that I am quite satisfied with the result overall.

### Will I be continuing to update this application after the deadline?
Yes, I will. This project has actually been a great learning experience for me in applying my diploma-related expertise in relation to web application development.
